This repository includes:
1. The combinatorial analysis of snRNA sequencing datasets extracted from zebra finch premotor nucleus HVC (right hemispheres), focusing on the clustering and characterization of (transcriptomically defined) GABAergic interneuron classes within the region. (see HVC_RNASeq_Analysis.r)

2. In vivo physiology and behavioral analysis of HVC interneurons obtained from high-density silicon probe single unit recordings (see siQuantifications.m and comboSiAnalysis.m under Si Probe folder). This assesses physiological categorization of HVC interneurons based on network-defined parameters.

3. In vivo physiology and behavioral analysis of HVC interneurons obtained from juxtacellular recordings with 2photon guidance (see juxQuantifications.m, juxFunctions.m, and comboJuxAnalysis.m under Juxta folder). This in combination with histological analysis creates linkage of molecular and functional classifications of zebra finch HVC interneuron subtypes.

4. Extraction and handling of audio data for sensory playback and singing activity (see findMotifsSetup.m and playbackMaker.m in Audio folder). 

5. An unpublished script aimed at combining juxtacellular and silicon probe datasets, with caveats that some parameters will be prone to technology-specific differences (see ComboJuxSi.m).
