This project includes:
1. The combinatorial analysis of snRNA sequencing datasets extracted from zebra finch premotor nucleus HVC (right hemispheres), 
focusing on the clustering and characterization of (transcriptomically defined) GABAergic interneuron classes within the region.
2. In vivo physiology and behavioral analysis of HVC interneurons obtained from A) high-density silicon probe single unit recordings
   and B) juxtacellular recording with 2photon guidance.
4. Physiological categorization of HVC interneurons based on network-defined paramaters in physiology datasets.
5. Linkage of molecular and functional classifications of zebra finch HVC interneuron subtypes.
